Tested environment
--------------
 1. ryu v3.22 or newer version
 2. Python 2.7/3.4

How to use it?
--------------
Start ryu application with dl_plugin
> $ ryu-manager dl_plugin ryu.controller.ofp_handler

And start cli.py, and you can use it!

> $ ./cli.py

What command I can use?
--------------
For now, this plugin provide :
 1. list: list all available ryu app from ryu.app module
 2. install: install a ryu application by id
 3. uninstall: uninstall a ryu application

TODO
--------------
1. Support both python 2.7 and python 3.4 (Done !)
2. Use python cmd module to implement it!(Done !)
3. Change from socket to REST API (Done !)
